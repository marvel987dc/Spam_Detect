The spam classifier demonstrates a robust approach to detecting spam messages using NLP and machine learning techniques and algorithms, by using Multinomial Na√Øve Bayers classifier, the model efficiently processes the data with preprocessing steps like Count Vectorization and TF-IDF transformer. The model achieved successfully promising results and evidence by the Cross-Validation accuracy and performance on test data.

However, we can try to use alternative algorithms in the future such as Logistic Regression, which handles large feature spaces well and provides interpretable results in terms of probability. Support Vector Machines, this one is effective in high dimensional spaces, works for non-linear data using kernel functions, etc.

In summary, this project achieved with all the requirements to be an optimal spam detector using machine learning, offering valuables insights for future enhancement and application to the real world.
