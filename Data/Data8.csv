4758,"Paul, my apologies for being irritable on the subject.  I'll tone down
the rhetoric.Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> Indeed - that I actually had understood prior to all this - for

speculation.  Bearing that disclaimer in mind, here's mine:  They make
money from selling boxed sets.  They're glad to make some versions
available for almost-unrestricted distribution (not ""for value"") via CD
duplication or the Internet that they estimate won't substitute for
boxed-set sales.For example, they _could_ have packaged what I call the ""FTP edition"" 
in ISO9660 images.  The fact that they didn't suggests to me that they
see the inconvenience of mirroring FTP Edition i386 files (which, at the
moment, are v. 8.0) as motivation for all but the really determined to
buy boxed sets, instead.  Likewise, they _could_ release a v. 8.0 (current) version of the
""evaluation"" single-disk ISO image.  Instead, they always keep it
several versions behind.  This again seems like an incentive to buy a
boxed set, after ""evaluating"" SuSE via the ISO image.Again, the above is my speculation (only) about their motivations.  All
we know of a certainty is what permissions they've granted, which are a
bit messy and complex, but nonetheless quite clear.Those permissions, as a reminder, apply to the SuSE-produced components,
YaST, YaST2, the distribution installer program, and possibly other
utilities that I don't know of.  _They_ wrote that code, and have every
right to grant or withhold permissions as suit them best.> One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't understand was that SuSE
> had proprietary extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow people to

it's possible to place somebody else's work under a new licence without
his permission.  Not so.  There is nothing in copyright law that would
make that possible.The copyright _owner_ has inherent rights in his (e.g., software) work,
and is entitled to issue as many _instances_ of his code under diverse
licences as he wishes.  (If he gives you a copy with no licence
statement, there's effectively a default licence by operation of
copyright law.  To avoid going into a long digression, let me just say
that it's a proprietary licence by default.  That's why, in order to
have open source software at all, there must be an explicit licence
from the copyright holder.)No Linux distribution _ever_ entails relicensing people's software
without their explicit permission -- since no such relicensing can occur
at all. 
 
You cannot get away with taking SuSE Linux AG's work and redistributing
it under what you claim to be a BSD licence, or the GPL, or anything at
all other than what the copyright owner has specified, because you
simply lack the right to do so.  Claiming to do it would be copyright
violation.> I thought that the model for the likes of SuSE was selling support and

contributors) had intended to prohibit putting GPLed works on the same
CDs as proprietary ones, and selling the result only via retail stores
(plus mail order, etc.) in shrink-wrapped boxes, I'm 100% certain they
could and would have done so.Guess what?  They did not.  They didn't even require that anybody give
you copies of the GPLed components, ever, at all.  All they did was
require that _if_ you received GPLed software lawfully, then you had to 
be able to get matching source code for a limited period, upon request.Spirit of the GPL, you say?  I'd suggest that Stallman and company knew
exactly what they were doing, and that the degree of access to GPLed
software is exactly what they had in mind.

> 
> Ai-je tort?Mais si.You are indeed under a misconception, and may want to read the text of
the GPL to verify this fact.  The GPL does _not_ entitle you to a copy
of any binary software.  Section 2 provides for rights to access to
matching source code _if_ you have lawfully received a copy of a covered
binary.  That section provides three alternative mechanisms for the
distributor to provide such access.  And SuSE _do_ actually provide 
exactly that access.Or so I think to be the case.  If you believe there's some GPLed
codebase that you can lawfully receive from SuSE whose matching source
code they are not making available exactly as required, please tell us
which codebase that is.  (That would be SuSE Linux AG's headache, not
any of ours, but it might be interesting to examine.)> My understanding was that binaries or whatever could be received for

provisions of the GPL concern access to _source code_, not binaries.
(2) It kicks in _only_ for people who've lawfully received covered
binaries.  (3) _Covered_ software means instances of codebases actually
placed under the GNU GPL by their copyright owners.  The mere act of 
placing a piece of software on a CD-ROM with GPLed software doesn't GPL
it.In fact, the assertion to the contrary is a favourite FUD tactic from
enemies of Linux:  They're forever trying to convince software producers
that using GPLed software in any way with their proprietary offerings
will ""taint"" their copyrights and force them to put their property under
the GPL.  It's simply not so.> If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a different issue, and
> one for which I would be willing to pay.That's nice, but they're not _offering_ the exact contents of the boxed
sets free of charge and lawful to duplicate & redistribute, or ""borrow"".
For one thing, as you will have noticed from my earlier listing of
components, the boxed sets' CD-ROMs include quite a lot of _third-party_
proprietary software.  SuSE Linux AG _cannot_ allow you (or your friend)
to hand out copies of that software freely, because it's not theirs in
the first place.
 
> I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll end up doing that!If you mean the 3-CD core set of RH 7.3, good.  It's a quite decent
distribution.  But bear in mind that the RH 7.3 boxed sets include
some other third-party applications whose owners would be very upset to
find them being copied or ""borrowed"". > I have now realised this, thanks to your kind explanations. I can
> borrow them, but not copy them? No.Look, it's a collection of software, many elements of which may not be
lawfully just given out to multiple people:  Your friend installing it,
then _not_ erasing it but merely letting you ""borrow"" the CDs results in
the product being installed in multiple places.  That's unauthorised
copying.> And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence terms on, say,
> trials for commercial company x to which I object, it is the way SuSE
> appears, at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have mixed up
> proprietary and open stuff.Well, if you don't like SuSE, then you probably won't like Caldera
eDesk, Xandros Desktop, Lycoris Deskop LX, Libranet, Lindows, or KRUD,
either.  Depending on your criteria, you also might not like Red Hat,
Linux-Mandrake, or Yellow Dog, since all of those have boxed-set retail
sets that include CD-ROMs that may not be publicly redistributed.
 
(I don't even use SuSE.  I'm just trying to clarify the licensing
question.)--

Hello, 
Premium Phone Qualified 
Business Opportunity Leads
If you're spending money marketing a Business Opportunity or MLM,
you will definitely be interested in 
what we have to offer you. 
You're tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having 
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.Â  Sometimes
calling 100 people without one single signup!Â  Sometimes 
talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches
to the point of them hanging up when you call!Â  (Leads oversold)
We're here to help! 
We'll get you qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity. 
Period. 
No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. 
We'll do it quickly, and professionally. 
And we won't ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results!Here's How We Generate Our Leads...
- All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!
- One source we use for Lead-generation is a Business Opportunity
Seeker Lead List of people who have requested info. about making 
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.Â  If they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.
- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following 
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
Name:
Email:
Phone:
Best time to call:
State:
Reason they want to work from home!:
How much they want to make per month:
How much time they can commit per week:
How much money they have available for startup:
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, 
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time* 
(only minutes old).Â  Never more than 24 hours old.Â  Guaranteed!
- We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name, 
Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when
the Lead was generated!Â  However, almost ALL leads will have
ALL of the information asked above.Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:
1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the 
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. They are Super-Fresh!Â  Delivered in Real-Time only moments 
after they are contacted and qualified!Â  (Not 30-120 days old)
3. They're Targeted.Â  Each Lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. They're Highly Receptive!Â  Receptivity is very, very high 
because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching 
them on opportunities!Â  Also they'll remember speaking to 
someone over the phone.Â  Especially since we tell them to 
expect your call!
5. No ""feast or famine"" activity.Â  Leads will be coming in 
regularly.Â  You dictate the flow!
6. No more cold calls!Â  We tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you 
get with each Lead!
8. Save Time.Â  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.
9. Lower ""burnout"" factor.Â  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier 
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due 
to higher closing ratios.Â  Of course, this builds faster and stronger 
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of 
""quick successes"".
12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. 
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead, 
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.
If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high
quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.Â  Just let us know 
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized 
lead-generation campaign for you. 
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been 
more critical than it is today, why not call us NOW!
These are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't 
just responding to some ""Generic Business Opportunity"" ad, they're 
contacted over the phone specifically for YOUR company!Â  And we 
forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not 
days, weeks, or months!Start Generating As Many SIGN-UPS as You Can Handle!
Explode Your Downline and Income!

                        information that could make a difference in how you advertise 
                        your business today and in the future!!!                        Hi, My name is Daniel and I have been involved in Internet 
                        Marketing since its inception. E-marketing provides individuals 
                        and businesses with a low cost solution for broad-based 
                        advertising                        If you are new to this concept do not fret! I was too! 
                        It took me over 2 years of research by scowering the Internet, 
                        dealing with false claims, hassling with the (so-called) 
                        ""bulk-mail specialists"" experiencing the trials 
                        and errors ""bogus"" software programs and false 
                        claims they make, to truly understand the ins & outs 
                        of marketing concepts and principles of email marketing.These 
                          processes are time consuming, resource intensive, frustrating 
                          and potentially expensive for individuals and companies 
                          to do on their own.
Let's 
                          face it! Most people in business want to make money! 
                          Their time is consumed by running their business, developing 
                          marketing campaigns and advertisement, cashing checks, 
                          dealing with customers, managing their staff and so 
                          on!
They 
                          don't have time to invest in learning 10 or 15 different 
                          software applications, learn how to effectively port 
                          scan for IPS, Socks and SMTP relays, spend thousands 
                          of dollars for ""The Best"" software applications, 
                          spend hours testing applications for the best results 
                          or for that matter, spending 2 or more years to learn 
                          what someone else has already mastered!
If 
                          you are interested in increasing your effectiveness 
                          with email marketing, increasing your client base, maximizing 
                          your target market or boosting you revenue in a specific

Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has
a widget for it.  You can achieve what you want with the command-line
mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt: sh -c 'for f in ""`folders -recurse -fast`"" ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'(The command ""sortm"" will sort a particular folder, and
""folders -recurse -fast"" prints out a list of all of your folders.)
I hope this helps,

1435,"Dear Sir/Ma, 
I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts.

years or so. This is one of those. Why?Because interest rates are definitely rising.Have you locked in the lowest rate (in THREE
DECADES yet!) for your present mortgage?Rates haven't been this low in almost 3 decades.
They may well never be this low again--ever. If
you haven't taken this opportunity to secure the
best possible rate on your home loan, you're
simply letting money slip through your fingers.At a few special times, it is SO easy to save
""big bucks""...and this is one of those times. Why
continue to pay more than is necessary and
continue to let future savings slip away?
  
We're a national mortgage provider. We're NOT a
broker. As such, we can guarantee you the lowest
possible rate and the best possible deal but only
if you act NOW.
 
There is no charge, cost or obligation to see if
this opportunity meets your needs. You can easily
determine if a new loan makes sense for you, and
exactly why, because we provide only ""easy to
understand"" quotes (in ""layman's terms"", in other
words).
 
We offer primary and secondary home loans and we
will be happy to show you in ""black and white""
why your existing loan is the best for you or why
you should replace it. Of course, there's no cost
to you at all to share your time with us. None. Take 2 minutes and use the link below that works
best for you. For 2 minutes of your time, we'll
show you how you can save you and your family
""big bucks"" today. This is a once-every-30-years
opportunity. So don't delay and ""miss the boat"".

July 17, 2002
						--Robert VamosiSenior Associate EditorCNET Software and Internet Services
Â Dear Readers,
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
 
						Â 
Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
 An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
 The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.
Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in 
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.

We All
Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today's Society.
Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed.
Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:Monday: The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do?
Tuesday:  The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""What now,"" you think to yourself.
Wednesday: You've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?Â 
Thursday: Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven't a clue how to handle
    it.Â 
Friday:  Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?And what about all the other things:Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified?
Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair?
Lost a Security Deposit?
Bought a Home or Purchased A Car?
Signed an Employment Contract?
Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
Had Trouble With Your Credit Report?
Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute?
Been Involved in a separation or divorce?
Had to Collect Child Support?
Prepared A Will or Wanted To?
In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
 but it provides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
 and it is for a small monthly fee. No Kidding.  Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

discussing TeS, (considering that you know *nothing* about it), certainly
looks like you are simply trying to throw doubt/negativity onto razor.Personally, I haven't used razor for a few months now because I want to
integrate it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even I can't comment on Razor at all.....Vipul & co, I think it would be great if there was more transparency in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, this will avoid all the stupid ""Oh, it isn't working again, and it took
me 324 days to work it out"" etc...Just my $1 worth...Regards,

evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
strange...On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.- Matthew

Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

Director) designed to allow the rapid creation of 3D-interactive 
applications.The second version of Virtools clearly builds upon previous 
releases, keeping a similar look while adding a host of new features that 
greatly improve the final package.

Forwarded-by: LZ A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping
with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would
turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would
erupt into cheers.However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead
silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, ""May I please
use the restroom?""The bartender replied, ""I really don't think you should.""""Why not?"" the pastor asked.""Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most
private part is covered only by a fig leaf.""""Nonsense,"" said the pastor, ""I'll just look the other way.""So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the
stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he
came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and
dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give
the pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and
said, ""Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just
because I went to the restroom?""""Well, now they know you're one of us,"" said the bartender.  ""Would
you like a drink?""""But, I still don't understand,"" said the puzzled pastor.""You see,"" laughed the bartender, ""every time the fig leaf is lifted
on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how
about that drink?""

Unlike the original .COM and .NET domain names, the new .NAME domain was specifically created for individuals such as yourself. The .NAME domain appears in the format: FirstName.LastName.NAME For example, if your name is Monica Smith, then you can register a name such as monica.smith.name Technology experts predict that personalized domain names will soon be used as international identifiers much the same was that phone numbers are used today. For a limited time, you can pre-register your unique .NAME domain for only $10 (plus applicable registry fees) at: http://www.namesforeveryone.com

It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.Got it?-James Rogers

------------------
Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,

It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.

  single address space?- one is a great number for an interface,
  as log(1) is 0, and specification can
  be implicit?- some combination of the above?Now, as Hoare says:
> There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
> it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
> make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.As programmers, we've been able to make
our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.-Dave(Oracle, in their quest for portability,
used to use raw disks for the database.
This finessed the filesystem issue; did
it also allow them to roll their own set
of async drivers?)

AQUEOUS KATHMANDU
*********************************For those who choose not to smoke ... we have something for you.  Introducing Aqueous Kathmandu ""Happy Drops"" (tm).Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops....(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety)....Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu....a.k.a. ""Secret Fire""....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene.... Who du the Kathmandu?  Now....everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive""; happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  Finally; we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a ""Sensitive"" herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops, Temple ""Quantum"" Variety, a.k.a....""Secret Fire"".  ""Secret fire""....indeed!!!This liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....
1) The ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, ""sensitive/responsive"" pipe-smoking product.
2) The ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (Please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  In the instance of Aqueous Kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.
3) A most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more ""absolute""; in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of ""Smoke"" possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that ""Smoke"" is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively
4) Therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a ""Smoke"" and a ""non-Smoke""....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  Each ""impeccable"" singularly.... And at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops and the more traditional Temple ""3"" Ragga Dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting ""camaraderie"". (Please refer to, ""Introductory Offers"".) * No need to smoke.  No carcinogenic factors!
* Absolutely legal!  No prescription required!
* Does not include cannibis or any tobacco variety.
* Marvelously potent.  Remarkably substantial!
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity!
* Adjusts attitude & mood enhancement. Relaxes stress & anxiety.
* Better than Kava Kava, St. John's Wort, etc.  Similar to but variant from Ragga Dagga.
* Certainly safer than pharmaceuticals!
* Many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives!
* Better sleeping ... better dreaming.
* Non-invasive ... no downside.
* An exquisite compliment with Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (tm) -- (See Intro Offers)
* Quite simply ... it is a Superior product!Contents: Aqueous Kathmandu is a unique botanical substantiality.  It is offered and marketed as such.  Undisputedly, it achieves ""distinctive accolade"" of its own merit....  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled or regulated or harmful herbs or cannabis factors.  However, it is our mandatory ethical policy that Aqueous Kathmandu not be offered to individuals who have not yet attained at least 21 years of age (all things in their time....).  Please note as well that Aqueous Kathmandu is not intended for usage during work or while driving.  And, as is true of all substance and indulgence, this product should not be enjoyed during pregnancy.  This proprietary formulation does include the following quantum-ratio, core-extracted/refined botanicals in an alcohol base as a preservative: Albizzia flower-tops, Drachsha, Chavana Prash, Lactuca Virosa, Hybrid Flowering Turnera Diffusa, Wild Dagga, Capillaris Herba, Angelica Root, Zizyphi Spinosae, Buplerum, Hybrid Valeriana officinalis Root, Albizzia flower-tops, mature Polygonum Vine, Calea Zacatechichi, Crocus Sativa flower-tops, Leonorus Sibricus buds, Cinnabaris, Margarita herba, Biotae Orientalis, Salviae Miltiorrhizae....

Keep out of reach of children.**************************
STONEY MAHONEY
**************************In regard to the introduction of Stoney Mahoney (tm) ""personal choice"" smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate ""Sensitive/Responsive"" (loose-leaf) smoking product, ""Amsterdam Cup"" style so to speak!With acquired knowledge via the development of such notable ""personal choice"" smokeables, as Wizard Smoke (tm), Dream Smoke (tm), Dragon Smoke (tm), Vajroli Mudra (tm), Stashish (tm), ShemHampHorash (tm), Yerba lena Yesca (tm), WeedÃ© (tm), Kathmandu Temple Kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty ""personal choice"" smoking status of our premier Ragga Dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  After all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded Ragga Dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  Mostly, we were right about this, as this new Stoney Mahoney ""agenda"" is not so much significant as in ""better"", but ""Signature Significant"" as in ""uniqueness,"" in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare ""true-brid"" variety of Artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into ""Absinthe,"" a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  As well, we have finally perfected our exclusive ""kiffening"" technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  Hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly ""potentiated"" Stoney Mahoney (tm) smoking product! Loose-leaf ""personal choice"" doesnâ€™t get any ""sweeter"" than this!  And for all of you Ragga Dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnâ€™t so much that Stoney Mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the Ragga Dagga solid-format.  Moreover, it is that Stoney Mahoney is effective in a much different way than Ragga Dagga.  Sort of like apples and oranges, like Panamanian and Jamaican, like Indica and Sativa, if you will!  Within our test marketing, even traditional ""Kind Bud"" aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this Stoney Mahoney jester variety.  Most folks say that Ragga Dagga motivates them in an up ""Sativa"" sort of way, and that Stoney Mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a ""soma,"" Indica sort of way.  If Stoney Mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme ""kiffening"" of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  It is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  As is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of Stoney Mahoneyâ€™s draw.  * Indica oriented.
* Definitely happy smoking!
* Mood enhancer.
* Smokeable & brewable mood food!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.
* Sleep deep -- Good-bye funky dreams!
* Hornier than horny goatweed!
* Superlative mixer with Ragga Dagga and/or Aqueous Kathmandu.
* Roll it or bowl it or brew it ...
* Just a pinch goes a long, long way ...
* Possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.
* Non-invasive.
* Absolutely Legal!
* Rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.Attention! Attention! We have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both Ragga Dagga and Stoney Mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes Ragga Dagga, Stoney Mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our Aqueous Kathmandu Happiness Drops (these are pretty special!).  And to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  A tea for theeâ€¦.)Please Note:  Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, ""Personal Choice,"" loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  No included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  There is no tobacco in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  There is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  And although we are not age-governed by law, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  As well, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm), factored in an Absinthium Labyrinthine Configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, ""Sensitive/Responsive,"" Smoking and/or Brewing Herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.As is an herbalistâ€™s way, three or four draws of Smoke should be inhaled and retained.  For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (Steep approximately one tea-spoon of Stoney Mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  When smoking Stoney Mahoney, please draw gently as Stoney Mahoney is a most preeminent ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (Water-pipe is included with each package of Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety).)Stoney Mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: Dutch Lactuca virosa, Bulgarian Artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Chinese Valeriana ceae, Jamaican Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus boldo, and European (flowering-tops only) Sarothamnus Scoparius. Stoney Mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Stoney Mahoney does indeed achieve distinction upon its own merit....*************************************************

4723,"Hi all,
I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering
if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.
I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the
scsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until
probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch
and installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to
burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed
cdburning to work fine.This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).
the cdrecord command I was using was
    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just
locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,
the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does
reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages
/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).
cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my
cdr drive and my cdrw).
The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a
kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives
the same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for
cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was
wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used
which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much
good, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is
a)  How to fix the problem ;-)
b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity
    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm
    not very knowledgeable on these things.
c)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If
    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond
    the guidelines on kernel.org)?Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully
received.

(((Please, no immediate lectures on the second law of 
thermodynamics. I have plenty of those.)))""16:00ï¿½02ï¿½Augustï¿½02""A way to turn carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons has caused 
a big stir at an industrial chemistry conference in New 
Brunwick, New Jersey. Nakamichi Yamasaki of the Tokushima 
Industrial Technology Center in Japan says he has a 
process that makes propane and butane at relatively low 
temperatures and pressures.""Link: Yes, he actually exists:
http://www.it.sakura.ne.jp/~koatsu/c_journal/ab/1_10/01-2.html
http://www.itc.pref.tokushima.jp/English/eindex.html""Making fuel from greenhouse gases""While his work still needs independent verification,  
(((okay, go fetch us some, then))) if he can make even 
heavier hydrocarbons, it might be possible to make petrol. 
It has carbon chains that are between five and 12 atoms 
long == butane is four atoms long.  (((""That's right, 
Professor: I just hook it up to the sky and I make 
gasoline!"")))   ""The work suggests the tantalising prospect that CO2, 
the main greenhouse gas, could be recycled instead of 
being pumped into the atmosphere.    ""Many people have tried before to make hydrocarbons by 
mixing carbon with hydrogen gas in a reaction chamber at 
very high temperatures, but yields have always been 
pitiful. Yamasaki has used hydrochloric acid as his source 
of hydrogen ions. (((""But where are we s'posed to get all 
that hydrochloric acid?"" Yes, I know, I know.)))    ""He bubbles the CO2 into a reaction vessel where it is 
heated to about 300 C at 100 times atmospheric pressure. 
The heat and pressure are low enough, says Yamasaki, to 
make it feasible to scale up the reaction so it can run on 
a power station's waste heat. (((Imagine the fun when a 
giant tank of pressurized acid blows up.)))""Iron powder    ""Using iron powder as a catalyst, Yamasaki says he has 
made substantial amounts of methane, ethane, propane and 
butane, which he was able to vent off as gases when the 
mixture cooled. If he can improve the catalyst's 
performance he is hopeful of making heavier hydrocarbons 
such as petrol, too.     ""William Siegfried, who has lead similar experiments 
at the University of Minnesota in the twin cities of 
Minneapolis and St Paul, says his group was only able to 
make methane at far higher temperatures. But his process 
also used a nickel-based alloy as a catalyst, rather than 
iron.    ""Siegfried's group was investigating whether natural 
methane deposits might have formed chemically with the 
metal in rocks acting as a catalyst rather than forming 
from the decay of rotting biological material over aeons.  
(((Paging Thomas Gold! ""Deep Hot Biosphere"" calling on 
line one.)))   ""Unless Yamasaki's technology can make the more 
valuable heavier hydrocarbons such as petroleum, which are 
liquid at room temperature, it will not be much more use 
than present-day bioreactors, in which bacteria that like 
to feed on CO2 are induced to produce methane. 'Organisms 
have a special talent for that kind of reaction,' says

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.

have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected
speech and action.  I think O'Neill on his soapbox doesn't
understand the distinction.All better?  Greg

1684,"Dear Sir,I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com
Kind regards,Stanley Woodwork.

   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law. - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court

   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.Dan

I know it's not a Linux prob and here is what I have encountered:I had the same problem when installing Win on it and eventually sorted it
out by disabling the infrared port. I'm guessing this might be same prob
although I'm not sure. I am very new to Linux so it's not that easy for me
to work it out. I did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage
(using images on disks) and it cuts out either as it's trying to verify what
CD-Rom I have or just after (hence my suspicion of the infrared port again).can anyone help ?thanks

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>01. READERS WRITE.  A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure 
with the links contained in Neat Net Tricks.  It seems he is bothered by 
the frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads 
should be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied 
that pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize 
that they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover 
his costs and possibly make a profit.  We suggested using a pop-up stopper 
(there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active 
pop-up windows.  Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee 
only sites without pop-up ads.  As we've often said in the past, the 
Internet isn't free and never was.  Someone has to pay the freight and if 
those ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist.02. EXTENSION SEARCH.  Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the 
database at http://extsearch.com/ information.03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED.  Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages 
we see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite 
""dumbness.""  A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks ""Do you click 
on banner ads.""  She asks, if you don't, how do you click ""No"" without 
clicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then 
sitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded ""To avoid seeing 
this screen again, always shut down Windows properly"" as if it was their 
fault. Another reader nominates the download site at 
http://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp 
for having a really dumb comment.  After downloading a Windows update, it 
says:  ""How to Get Started -- You don't need to do anything after 
downloading"" and he asks, ""what's the point of downloading?""  Still another 
reader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet 
Information Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating.  Thus, the 
entire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is 
inaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it.  But judging 
by the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the 
message that ""Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to 
Continue.""  Keep them coming and we'll do it again in a future issue!04. XP TWEAK.  A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that 
can be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by 
the Tweak at that link.  Never fear, XP folks, you'll find a whole array of 
power tools included Tweak - all for XP - at 
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp .. . . . .1, 400+ Neat Net Tricks tips updated 4 times yearly for the word processing 
format of your choice, also in ebook format, plus extra features,

for Santa) at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store.. . . . .05. HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS TOOL.  Windows98 users have a neat tool at their 
fingertips without downloading.  Click on Start and Run and enter ""hwinfo 
/ui"" without quotes.  The information displayed is color-coded.  Error 
messages are in red, warnings are in blue.  Green denotes registry entries, 
Configuration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown 
in magenta.06. TRAINING WINDOWS.  One pet peeve is Windows' determination to identify 
a shortcut icon as ""Shortcut to (whatever)""  This is pure redundancy, since 
shortcuts are identified by an arrow.  And, with the added verbage of 
""Short cut to"" you can't jump from one icon to another by pressing the 
first letter (since they would all start with an ""s"".  If you keep removing 
""Shortcut to,"" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future 
shortcuts won't include ""Shortcut to"".07. HOLD THAT BUTTON.  The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites 
you to hold the mouse key down.  Now, before you hastily jump to 
conclusions that there's nothing more to this site, when you release the 
button, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button 
holders.  And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest 
record was a little over six hours, proving once again that some folks need 
to get a life.08. HAGAI'S FREEWARE.  A baker's dozen (13) freeware programs are at

checker, screen saver loader, clock, shutdown utility, CD autorun, boot 
editor, menu, counter,icon viewer and editor, and more.09. ONLINE HELP.  Of limited scope, but considering that you can never get 
enough help with your computer, try http://www.computerhope.com/oh.htm .. . . . .Apologies to those readers who were inconvenienced with multiple issues of 
NNT Issue #137.  As luck would have it, Lyris (our mail server) had 
hardware failure causing some of the repeated distribution. We'd like to 
tell you that there will never be another problem in future mailings, and

TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the MassesWhile security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces
of the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they
have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as
far as concerns such as privacy and security go, or
alternatively, in terms of how they would impact the
functionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analysts
both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from
these standpoints, while paying much less attention to what
the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content
control itself really means.The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not
whether they may interfere with the power of the universal
logic device, or whether they are effectual from the
standpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these
are all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental
problem they present is in the political premises that they
hope to implement for the sake of the ""content industries.""TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the
concepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
Treaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May
20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The
WPPT declares an unprecedented ""moral right"" of authors to
control public uses of their works.*That's* the real game plan.TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the
masses.  They constitute an effort to ""democratize"" content
control under the concept of ""moral rights,"" encouraging the
public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised
by the specter of content control, and to confuse these
issues with private interest issues such as privacy and
security.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on
the bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's
really on the line.In America, we have never supported the concept of ""moral
rights"" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution
accords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive
rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting
the progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the
purpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though
that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights
statutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court
explicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good
reason.  In America, we implicitly understand the
distinction between expression, the aspect of works to which
copyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make
up a work, to which it does *not* apply.The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must
be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:
information is free.  It's not that it *wants* to be -- it
*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,
however, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes
to ""universal content control"" for the sake of so-called
""moral rights"" implemented at the behest of narrow content
industry interests.TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage
the general public, and more specifically producers of
information products in general, to identify content control
with ""moral rights,"" blithely overlooking the real
implications of information technology in a free society,
and the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding
the freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the
prospects of information technology crucially depend.Seth Johnson-- [CC] Counter-copyright:

5142,"If you run Pick, and then use the ""New FTOC"" button to show only
those messages selected by pick, then the ftoc display was considered
""invalid"" in the old code.  This prevented the display from being cached,
and it meant that you could get back to the full folder display by
clicking on the folder lablel.  That doesn't work anymore.  You have
to resort to Rescan Folder.  In fact, when you change folders you
continue to have the Pick results, not the new folder contents.
If you go to a any folder and do Rescan, then it heals itself.

2809,"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of 
todayâ€™s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by 
centralization.Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one 
answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate 
agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific 
context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid 
value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) 
according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more 
slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the 
basis for todayâ€™s most popular architectural style for developing 
network applications: client-server interaction using request-response 
communication protocols.I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already 
encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the 
beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the 
separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, 
unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a 
centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a 
third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as 
abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these 
limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and 
communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light 
and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized 
information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.

many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

  Gaim Changelog
    http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLogGaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
vulnerable.The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
in the buddy list window.Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also

5131,"[1] Covalent works with Microsoft to provide ASP.NET capabilities for
Apache 2.0.  ASP.NET actually has some really elegant tools for doing
load testing and analysis. Perhaps Microsoft's desire to embrace, extend, and
extinguish comes from a scathing Gartner report recommending not to deploy
IIS for enterprise applications at all.   Now users get the best of both
worlds: all the development tools of ASP.Net and the security and reliability
of Apache.Greg--

1506,"DEAR SIR,I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.Best personal regards,MRS MARIAM ABACHA.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--

Civilization' are essentially equivalent IMHO.  But it need not be so.> D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or

you're given a bog standard Dell box and linux won't work
with the graphics card on it.At the moment at work, if we want a new workstation, we just
buy whatever Sun's latest system is, we jumpstart it, and 
that's it, it's up and running.
Basically the whole installation procedure is
""boot net - install""
This is exactly what you need when you are administering a large

your life on Dells website and messing around with drivers
and compiling new versions of X. That's fine if you've got
one machine at home, hey, I've done it myself, but
when working with a large bunch of systems, it's impossible.

5516,"On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
anyone else.If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
vulnerability, if possible.  This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
was.The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
underground, vulnerable.The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
long as possible.iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
information.If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
together, add up to a catastrophe.First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
--- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
are good at networked theft may not yet exist.There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
Samba, for example.Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
increase the availability of that information to the people who can
afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.Let's not let that happen.

Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM
Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
Greetings,iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
provides answers to some basic questions about the program:Q. How will it work?
A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
of motivations, including the following:         * Pure love of security research
         * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
         * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
         * The publicity that often accompanies disclosureThe VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
items:         * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
         * The amount of detail and analysis provided
         * The potential severity level for the information shared
         * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
           software and hardware potentially affected
         * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
         * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSEQ. Who should contribute to the VCP?
A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
entity.Q. Why are you launching this program?
A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
public at large are warned in a timely manner.Q. Who gets the credit?
A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
exploit information.Q. When can I contribute?
The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
contact us at contributor@idefense.com.Regards,Sunil James

C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const.
So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the
caching for you.I do not think this is possible in C, though?You could write the same code fragment as:
============================
for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a<l;a++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(b==l-4)
        do_something();
}
============================Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very
long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be:
============================
char c;
char* p;
for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++)
{
    some_thing_goes_here();
    if(*(p+4)==0)
        do_something();
}
============================This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance
because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do
array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as
most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code
illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer
Java for most programming tasks. :)- Matthew

254,"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.Order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now for only $49.97

although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a

Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting

have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have

LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren Dugas""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""History of LDAP http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications. DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windowsï¿½ operating system or the Macintosh. The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.""
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

by Elaine LiesJAPAN: August 5, 2002   ""TOKYO == In what could be the ultimate in public works 
projects, a Japanese panel of experts has proposed 
relieving the misery of steamy Tokyo summers by cooling 
the huge city with sea water and a labyrinth of 
underground pipes.    ""Though summers are hard in any city, Tokyo's narrow 
streets, hordes of people and clusters of massive 
skyscrapers, largely unrelieved by greenery, produce a 
special brand of discomfort.   ""And it gets worse every year.  (((Oh yeah.  You bet it 
does.))) The number of nights when temperatures stay above 
25 Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) in Tokyo has doubled over the 
last 30 years, while average temperatures have shot up by 
2.9 degrees C over the last century. Relief, however 
distant, could be on the way.  (((""Great news, weather 
sufferers!  We live in the high-tech capital of a G-7 
state!"")))   ""At the behest of the Construction Ministry, the panel 
has drawn up a plan that would use a network of buried 
pipes, and water pumped from the sea, to cool things down. 
'In the very best conditions, certain areas could in 
theory become as much as 2.6 degrees Celsius cooler,' said 
Yujin Minobe, a ministry planner.    ""The huge air-conditioning systems currently used to 
cool buildings get rid of the heat they take out of the 
structure by venting it into the outside air, raising 
temperatures still further and creating a 'heat island' 
phenomenon in large cities.  (((Soon whole *cities* will 
do it and vent their heat straight into the rising seas! 
Look out, Antarctica.)))    ""Under the plan, this heat would be transferred to 
water in large underground tanks, and the water then 
pumped through a six-km (3.7-mile) network of underground 
pipes to a cooling plant on the Tokyo waterfront.    ""There the heat from this water would be transferred 
to cooler sea water before the then-cooled water was 
pumped back through the underground pipes. The sea water, 
now warmed, would be released into the waters of Tokyo 
Bay.    ""COSTLY PLAN.  (((That's unsurprising.)))  Minobe said 
the plan would cover some 123 hectares (304 acres) in the 
centre of Tokyo, including the Marunouchi business 
district and the posh Ginza shopping area, and would 
initially cost around 41 billion yen ($344 million).    ""'Savings on reduced energy usage would eventually 
help pay for this,' he said.  (((A real nest of ironies 
here, folks.))) Officials quoted in the English-language 
Japan Times said energy savings would total more than 1 
billion yen a year, meaning the system would pay for 
itself in a bit over 30 years.    ""However, Minobe said many problems remained with the 
plan, which has only been under discussion since April 
last year. One of the most serious problems is whether 
warmer water being returned to Tokyo Bay would damage the 
fragile marine ecosystem, a point Minobe said still 
required more study.  (((Give it 30 years and there won't 
be any ecosystem left to study.)))    ""He said the average temperature cut is likely to be 
only around 0.4 degrees. 'I'm not even sure people would 
be able to feel that difference,' he said. Any such plan, 
however, would likely produce a gleam in the eyes of 
Japan's huge construction industry, known for its 
propensity for public works projects. Although several are 
decried as wasteful, public works projects have long been 
used by the government in attempts to stimulate the 
economy.  (((Nice use of the word ""attempts."")))    ""Frankly, I think this plan is still really more of a 
dream than anything else,"" Minobe said. O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O

xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXThank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.

Hash: SHA1Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.
The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,
expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at
the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good""
of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else
to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized
crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest
nation.Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago
have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally
irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in
government.As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly
usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will
be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and
special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the
cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize
to such perfection.
All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded
by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not
religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.
*Commerce*.
If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites
who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects
on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called
""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the
highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,
foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for
a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the
families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the
property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the
event.And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as
tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square
feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.
In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic
internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially
decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,
economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition
and statism.It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower
Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but
it's going to happen sooner or later.And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who
died at the World Trade Center.Cheers,

REVIEW & OUTLOOKA Living MemorialAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the
six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone
else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who
died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who
perished would be a living one.The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,
especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of
heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of
the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were
attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best
expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be
to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries
working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of
productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin
Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has
been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous
rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the
Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and
scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now
clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,
and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance
to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out
what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor
George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November
re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the
memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the
commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space
for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning
to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so
successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for
an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's
anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They
want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas
- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have
had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in
New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World
Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are
cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own
anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One
family group even called a press conference to reject as
disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident
that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center
isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great
cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all
rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban
life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port
city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a
statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to
be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were
affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,
you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary
War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World
War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it
disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on
around the walls containing their names.In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the
emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.
Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres
devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures
on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would
severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised
his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the
press and has since ducked for cover.Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe
those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking
more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best
way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

Strange.I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo, 
and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it.As far as I remember the problem I was having was 
that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's
 RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,
 and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,
 and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.You must be having a different error
Else
PnP is still turned on.
<>
Making sure the IRQ and io space you assign
the card in it's firmware is not in use by
any other ISA devices.

2166,"I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.The article makes four main points.
1) Absence of critical clauses. 
In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.
2) Specification in English only.That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.
3) Arbitary licence change.The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.
{David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).}4) Hidden defects.Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.
{Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).
Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.
The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.}5) Roughly.There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.-----  Whole Article. -----------
Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.
Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.
Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.Absence of critical clauses.The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).Specification in the English language.Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 
Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.
A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.
Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.
In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 
The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".
An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 
For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.
You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.
You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 
The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.
The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)
This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.
LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.Roughly Speaking.
Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.
The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

2629,"[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the 
article I was commenting on... Rohit]In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The 
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
the article.Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
of the Web?To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...Best,
   Rohit Khare===========================================================The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Googleâ€”up to a pointSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print editionIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
is gougou, meaning â€œdoggyâ€. For the country's fast-growing population of 
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaâ€”apparently 
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
restored.An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
to far less powerful search engines in China.Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this

dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.--

20020718 Lockergnome Windows Daily
Â  07.18.2002 GnomeREPORT GET WINDOWS XP TIPS: Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. GET YOUR COPY of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!    I don't go to many concerts, but that doesn't mean I don't
appreciate listening to good
music at every waking moment. Tonight, a handful of Bay
Gnomies and I watched They Might Be Giants rock the Fillmore.
Melanie, Steve, Brent, Missy, Robert, Patrick, Gretchen, Matt, and
Mindy had a total blast. Well, it wasn't much fun when Robert got
his digital camera confiscated - but this was a show worthy of
five megapixels
(believe me)! Brent went to
the show last night, and I saw them play on the set earlier this
afternoon. They were selling a new CD (which had JUST been
released the other day); ""They Got Lost"" is full of a few
previously-unavailable tracks. If you aren't sure about purchasing
it outright, I strongly urge you to sign up for a trial EMusic account and download
a few of their songs in MP3 format. Oh, and check out the opening
act: Noe Venable. She's got
a few free MP3s on
her site, too. Give ""Boots"" a shot - very nice.Does anybody know how to set a binary clock? Melanie got it for me
as a gift (which was a very nice gesture). Sure, I could read the
manual - but the ones and zeros start to look eerily similar after
flipping past the first page. You know me: I'm not much of a math
guy. In fact, I just discovered the other day that 'byte' was
short for 'by eight' (even though I already knew that 'bit'
represented 'binary digit'). I'd stick with a digital timepiece,
but it just isn't geeky enough for me anymore. How sad is that?
I'm ready to walk on the wild side. Maybe I'll get my laptop
pierced tomorrow? It could happen. I've been known to do nutty
things on a moment's notice, like changing my default Web browser.
Courtesy of Asa
Dotzler, I have an official Mozilla sticker, CD, and t-shirt
(which you saw me model in my Webcam the other day). Don't be too
jealous; Mozilla.org has
plenty of goodies to go around.Looks as though Jake
and Lori are already having a blast in St. Louis.
They're at the Shareware Industry Conference, along with hundreds
of well-known program programmers - the people who make our
computers work the way we want them to work! We're doing our best
to convince them to join us at Gnomedex. They ask: ""Who else
is going to be there?"" We answer: ""People who don't know you yet.""
They ask: ""Then why should I come?"" We answer: ""Because it's a
business opportunity for you."" They ask: ""What if I don't want to
learn anything or meet anybody?"" We answer: ""We can't really help
you there, but here - have lunch on us."" They ask: ""Oh, the
admission price includes food at at Gnomedex?"" We answer: ""We
cannot provide every meal, but you won't go hungry."" They ask:
""So, why Des Moines, when there's nothing to do there."" We answer:
""You're 100% wrong. There *IS* something to do there: Gnomedex.""
Get it? Got it? Good.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

I would forget my own head if it wasn't attached. So naturally, I appreciate any program that can help keep me on track, and with GigAlarm I can setup whatever reminders/alarms I need. However, sometimes a simple text message just won't catch my attention. Well, herein lies the beauty of GigAlarm... it doesn't just have to give you a text alarm! GigAlarm can play a WAV file (random, or your selection), change your background, start a program, or use one of the many Windows shutdown options. My wife has gotten in the habit of using the Shutdown option as an alarm to signal that I have spent too long on the computer. (Lucky for me, there is a snooze button!) NOTE: The author says, ""This program is essentially free to use for non-profit purposes... If you find this program useful I would appreciate $10 AUD (or $5 USD) as a token of your appreciation.""Context Thumbview v1.0.b1 [107k] W9x/2K/XP FREEhttp://contextmagic.netfirms.com/image-viewer/{Peep show} I'm not always very patient, especially when it comes to my computer. Double-clicking on an image and waiting for it to come up in my image viewer is almost too much for me to handle. Lucky for me, Context Thumbview has made its way onto my system and I no longer have to wait to view an image. All I do now is right-click the image, choose ""View Thumbnail,"" and there is the image, out there for me to see... all without me having to open up any programs! ""As Express ThumbView is an Explorer extension, it is always ready and available for use. Moreover, it is available in any Explorer window, including Open and Save As... dialog boxes."" As an added bonus, with Context Thumbview installed on my system, I can also turn off the thumbnail view if I want to save system resources.

Starter v5.5.4.2175 [423k] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://codestuff.tripod.com/{Startup manager} This application bills itself as ""Yet Another Startup Manager""... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.Recommend It!

Aversoft Sticker v3.55 [592k] W9x/2k/XP US$15
    Unearthed by Sergei Lepyokhinhttp://www.aversoft.com/sticker/{Sticky notes} Did you know that Post-it(r) Notes were invented by accident? I use to have these notes all over my monitor. Now my screen is clean as a whistle! Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember ""important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop."" No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook.

Â GnomeTIPGnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: ""Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?"" Alex also had this to say: ""When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options)."" Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.

The ""almost"" is because it's not updating the highlighting on

Texas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to SpendAugust 25, 2002
By RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG 
 It was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when
he became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways
last March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner
and meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and
renegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped
through his files and found the number for the Texas
Pacific Group, an investment firm headed by David
Bonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation
for fixing problem companies. Mr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,
had watched Texas Pacific's partners turn an investment of
$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed
for bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600
million. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in
America West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. That search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let
Texas Pacific have a role in US Airways' revival? asked
Richard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.
Siegel reached. In June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days
before US Airways announced its plans to file for
bankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated
about $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas
Pacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to
kick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep
the company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to
buy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,
and take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges
from bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a
better offer. ""One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks
were,"" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in
an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""There aren't
many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to
delve into the airline industry."" Texas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying
businesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman
made their names during the recession of the early 1990's
with investments in Continental and America West. The
firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping
companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its
extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. Now the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last
year alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six
acquisitions, most in unloved industries like
semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,
it announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been
losing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding
for Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. The most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these
deals could be Texas Pacific's acquisition last November of
MEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6
- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150
million bank loan. In the last few years, most firms that specialize in
leveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and
other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -
have been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made
managements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are
for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. Texas Pacific is different. ""This is a terrific environment
for them,"" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. Mark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the
West, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: ""Most
other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.
You don't see many guys wanting to take on operational
fixes."" Like most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep
its inner workings private: its partners rarely grant
interviews and its Web site is perpetually under
construction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,
the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for
this article. Mr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and
bright, patterned socks. ""He likes argyle socks, and they
tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said Henry Miller, an
investment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in
his career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman
argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. When a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known
for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking
in places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.
""Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on
my caller I.D., I know it's David calling,"" said one
investment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. Mr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the
chief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.
Mr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making
early bets in industries like cable television and taking
stakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,
which had been seized by the government. Over nearly a
decade, Mr. Bonderman's picks earned an average annual
return of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. In 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.
Coulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also
worked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with
Mr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &
Company, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. The three men have complementary skills, investment bankers
and other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master
strategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and
the detailed management of the firm's purchases. Mr. Price
often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. ""David is very much the optimist, very much the deal
maker,"" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of
Continental. ""Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.
He will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will
approach investments a little bit more skeptically than
David does."" By the end of the 1990's, Texas Pacific was well
established in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion
from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To
celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented San
Francisco's City Hall and hired the B-52's to play at a
party. But as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific
hesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no
deals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate
blowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but
stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the
businesses untenable. Instead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing
investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during
that stretch. ""They started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said Mario
Giannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money
management firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific
investors. The good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for Texas
Pacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that
needed its help. But Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the
rough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health
maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the
mid-1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new
managers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a
$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian
motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than
quadrupled. But Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at
the top of the market. Texas Pacific's $560 million
investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for
which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,
has been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of
Bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand
for luxury goods. Texas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a
semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,
both of which filed for bankruptcy. Some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's
performance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in
two investment funds it raised over the last decade. The
first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and
including investments made through March 1997, should
return more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific
investor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997
- could return less than half that, this investor
estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on
these investments before the stock market sank. But because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings
in the second fund, profits on these investments could
rebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new
management in place, J. Crew will turn around as the
economy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, ""their
returns look pretty good when you consider that some other
funds won't return any capital"" to investors. But with the weak economy throwing many companies into
trouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier
success, the investor said. ""They should do exceptionally
well,"" he said. Texas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It
relies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure
troubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except
for surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it
replaces managers. Less than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,
for example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his
old friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it
to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. Continental's board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then
brought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and
in October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief
executive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul
of the company and is now considered a great turnaround
artist of the industry. ""The biggest conflict I've ever seen was with Bob
Ferguson,"" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for
the Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the
thinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982
Braniff bankruptcy. ""He chose Bethune over his longtime
friend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a
better job."" At America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more
extensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was
led by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. W. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.
Coulter's home in San Francisco to interview for the job of
chief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.
Parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat
kindred spirits."" The board replaced most senior managers at America West,
except William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped
down last September. His restructuring plan had made the
airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from
bankruptcy in August 1994. Texas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth
about $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and
the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. ""These are not passive investors, nor am I,"" said Donald L.
Sturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental's
board with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. ""You're active.
Your money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake."" After overseeing managers who worked successfully with
unions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a
good reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways
was interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris
Chiames, a spokesman for the airline. Mr. Siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor
friendly as possible,"" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can
still entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the
billionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed
interest. Texas Pacific's investment in Burger King, made with
Goldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two
years of discussions among Texas Pacific's partners and the
chain's franchisees - even before the company, which had
been owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for
sale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National
Franchisee Association, which represents most Burger King
franchisees. ""We liked what they had to say about the human component of
the businesses they buy,"" Mr. Josephson said. Many other
owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" At Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an
executive it knows. Burger King's chief executive is John
Dasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,
who met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest
bought out their stake in Continental in 1998. Unlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored
with the technology industry, despite the failure of so
many start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the
semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is
highly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. The firm's 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,
which makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,
has been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and
took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of
its stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger
investment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip
maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in
Asia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for
bankruptcy last year. Texas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third
company, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6
billion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last
year. Its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,
may prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the
payment to E.On, based in Dï¿½sseldorf, Germany, was actually
more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal
said. Texas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company
of the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to
guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas
Pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of
which it swapped for more stock in the company. ""They did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said
Nabeel Gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted
that in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit
since the fourth quarter of 2000. But Texas Pacific's interest in airlines is clearly
sizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America
West and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,
the catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. Two years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount
ticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75
million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to
invest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.
Hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as
Priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site
but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until
after the sale. The contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt
Hotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that
the company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific
remains committed to it. Last spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to
talk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman

249,"It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.Order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now for only $49.97

trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.Â  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.Â  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""Â  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.Â  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!Â  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.Â  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.Â I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.Â  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!Â  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.Â  This is my
pledge to you.BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!Â  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

Date: Not suppliedA lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.
- The link toolbar is: 
- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?
-  link what?- The sidebar is 
- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate- Form auto-fill 
- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically- Downloads 
- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.- Toolbars should 
- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason- Composer should 
- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.- Mail should 
- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.
Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. Why? A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.[1] http://www.mozillanews.org

Techs fall with consumer sentiment
A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.
Rivals help improve Dell's outlook 
Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals.
The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39% Lukewarm response to Juniper moves 
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive. JUNIPER NETWORKS 7.70 6.65% Asia proves sweet spot for Yahoo
Web portal Yahoo, which broke a long streak of losses in the second quarter, said it hopes to ride on Asia's acceptance of online advertising and focus on wireless content to boost its regional business.
""Asian advertisers who use traditional media like newspapers and TV are moving more into online ads as they see the value and efficiency that it delivers,"" Niren Hiro, Yahoo's general manager for Southeast Asia, said in an interview Thursday. ""That's why we've seen in the last quarter clients who have traditionally stayed away from new media like us starting to divert their budgets in our direction.""YAHOO INC 12.9400 0.15479876%

J.P. Morgan downgrades Powerwave Technologies to ""long-term buy"" in tech notes 7/12/02 
Analyst Ed Snyder lowers his rating from ""buy"" despite a strong quarter from the wireless communications gear maker. Powerwave has a diversified customer base and fewer competitors now, Snyder suggests. But he cuts his estimates and rating based on lower guidance from the company, weak third-generation (3G) wireless network orders, and likely cuts in carrier capital expenditures. The infrastructure market remains lumpy and hard to predict, Snyder says.POWERWAVE TECHNOLOGIES 6.61 -13.03%

AOL on the hunt for new CEO 
AOL Time Warner has begun casting a net for a chief executive for its beleaguered America Online division.
The move comes as no surprise. Former AOL CEO Barry Schuler stepped down from the position in April. But it raises questions about the future of Robert Pittman, AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer and the interim head of AOL. Pittman had been charged with fixing the division. As previously reported, sources in the company speculate that Pittman will not return to his duties as COO once he completes his stint at AOL.AOL TIME WARNER INC 13.14 -4.09%

the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:

case statement, which IMHO is cleaner than using an if statement if you
have a lot of branches... but then again maybe that should be refactored
away with polymorphism :)

slow mode on Friday and didn't consider combining with `head`To remove newlines then handiest is: tr -d '\n'thanks,

         carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
         Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. ""I am here at
         the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
         would check to see if there is connectivity"", she writes,
         somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit

         reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd

         they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk

         or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
         them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
         imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail

         fireworks, ""60ft-tall Martian fighting machines"" wreaking 
         ""havoc and destruction"", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with

         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new

Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the

work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on

American Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all the
colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, the
issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  It
sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was
economically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering
IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper
as the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too
much money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot of
incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is
incredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of
circulation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was
exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada
had much effect.  And Canada is still a prosperous country.

> Vendors wrote their own wierd-ass installers & config tools to lock

> availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competitionI think the words you are looking for are ""competitive advantage"" or
""differentiation"".Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software
distribution mechanisms of their own organisations.IMHO, as always...
- Matthew[1] Depending on your world view, this may be rephrased as ""they need to
make oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive."" This discussion
is beyond the scope of this list. :)[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.__________________________________________________

of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare
little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic (you can still
find a seat at noon at Village by the Grange)When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.

2821,"I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. 
I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in 
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything 
specific on this scenario.Here's the situation. 
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into 
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it 
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of 
this file, I use 
 :0fw
 | spamc
to call spamassassin.Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do 
for our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed 
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about 
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion 
on this point is immaterial)
:0
  * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR
  { }
:0 c
 $SAVEATI have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their 
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
  * ^From: .*spermfun.com
  /dev/nullNow I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another 
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her 
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
  !user@domain.tldIt almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a 
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with 
:0 
 * ^Subject: .*test
  procmail.holder
and get the same result.The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files 
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the 
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun 
example above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other 
messages.  In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- 
other users have no problems.Any suggestions would be helpful :) -Russ

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their

making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong,
immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and
the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or
some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to
get attention is fine.> That picture

off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were
not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing
about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police
arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That
attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what

in someone's face.One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking
out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.
They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public
listen to them on matters of national security?So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your
answr boils down to ""i don't give a shit about what happens to the US"", you

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?_______________________________________________________________________

around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households.  (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner 
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.The census figured $18k as the cutoff for

5755,"Macromedia Shockwave Flash Malformed Header OverflowRelease Date: August 8, 2002Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)Systems Affected:
Macromedia Shockwave Flash - All Versions;
Unix and Windows; Netscape and Internet ExplorerDescription:
While working on some pre-release eEye Retina CHAM tools, an exploitable
condition was discovered within the Shockwave Flash file format called SWF
(pronounced ""SWIF"").Since this is a browser based bug, it makes it trivial to bypass firewalls
and attack the user at his desktop. Also, application browser bugs allow you
to target users based on the websites they visit, the newsgroups they read,
or the mailing lists they frequent. It is a ""one button"" push attack, and
using anonymous remailers or proxies for these attacks is possible.This vulnerability has been proven to work with all versions of Macromedia
Flash on Windows and Unix, through IE and Netscape. It may be run wherever
Shockwave files may be displayed or attached, including: websites, email,
news postings, forums, Instant Messengers, and within applications utilizing
web-browsing functionality.Technical Description:
The data header is roughly made out to:[Flash signature][version (1)][File Length(A number of bytes too
short)][frame size (malformed)][Frame Rate (malformed)][Frame Count
(malformed)][Data]By creating a malformed header we can supply more frame data than the
decoder is expecting. By supplying enough data we can overwrite a function
pointer address and redirect the flow of control to a specified location as
soon as this address is used. At the moment the overwritten address takes
control flow, an address pointing to a portion of our data is 8 bytes back
from the stack pointer. By using a relative jump we redirect flow into a
""call dword ptr [esp+N]"", where N is the number of bytes from the stack
pointer. These ""jump points"" can be located in multiple loaded dll's. By
creating a simple tool using the debugging API and ReadMemory, you can
examine a process's virtual address space for useful data to help you with
your exploitation.This is not to say other potentially vulnerable situations have not been
found in Macromedia's Flash. We discovered about seventeen others before we
ended our testing. We are working with Macromedia on these issues.Protection:
Retina(R) Network Security Scanner already scans for this latest version of
Flash on users' systems. Ensure all users within your control upgrade their
systems.Vendor Status:
Macromedia has released a patch for this vulnerability, available at:

on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
loaded, as JavaScript functions do.And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
browser.""===
""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
applications.""""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
for the file.""

 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrÃ©s might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

It isn't a ""version"" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.(Here's a neat trick, touch ""Makefile"" and ""makefile"", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of ""makefile"", and don't bother formatting for
UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every
now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
somewhere down the road. )Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.As for your initial question,

is key to decentralization. Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.
Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
  by have some play with time and value
Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
  called congnitive dissonance theory
Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
The local information when combined with the technical
troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization
to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
concerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,

Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.htmlThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """,0

the other sets severe problems, and Set5 blows the f-n rate on everything
it's predicting -- when the rates across runs within a training set vary by
as much as a factor of 25, it suggests there was systematic bias in the way
the sets were chosen.  For example, perhaps they were broken into sets by
arrival time.  If that's what you did, you should go back and break them
into sets randomly instead.  If you did partition them randomly, the wild
variance across runs is mondo mysterious.

collection.  I added code to strip uuencoded sections, and pump out uuencode
summary tokens instead.  I'll check it in.  It didn't make a significant
difference on my usual test run (a single spam in my Set4 is now judged as
ham by the other 4 sets; nothing else changed).  It does shrink the database
size here by a few percent.  Let us know whether it helps you!Before and after stripping uuencoded sections:false positive percentages

Captured weapons-grade uranium weighing more than 33 pounds is on display at the paramilitary police headquarters of southeast province of Sanliurfa, Turkey, September 28, 2002. Turkish gendarmes seized the uranium and detained two men accused of smuggling the material, Anatolian Agency said. Authorities believe the uranium came from an eastern European country and has a value about $5 million. (Anatolian via Reuters)Â

ship to US only"".  However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here.  For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft.  I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).Later,

spec file since you have to change the ""Source:"" as well as ""%setup"" to
reflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the
way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the
final version and that only the archive name has a ""pr1"" or ""beta6"" in it
for example.Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as
""0.61-fr0.x"" since the entire source has only ""0.61"" tags everywhere, no
preversion tags whatsoever.Still, I don't think ""Epoch:"" is an evil hack although it's true that it
may cause problems between distributions when used. Wanting to avoid it
when possible is a good thing indeed ;-)Matthias--

  TP> headers.I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science studentI guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.Jeremy

6-10 messages.Note that running a single spam through ""spamassassin -a -t"" *will*
eventually whitelist the spammer.  but that's why the man page tells you
